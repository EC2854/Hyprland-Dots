# Laptops 
> [!WARNING]
> There is a ags config for laptops that adds battery indicator and brightness slider.
> to enable them uncomment lines in `./.config/ags/modules/bar/sysinfo/sysinfo.js`(line 16) and `./.config/ags/modules/dashboard/dashboard.js`(line 21)

# Terminal
To use dynamic accent color in terminal (prompt, fastfetch). u need to set config files to dynamic. U can use `chprompt`(alias for `~/.config/starship/changeprompt.sh`) to set both of them
